/**
 * An interface that abstracts file system operations.
 *
 * You need to pass a file system client into Git commands that do anything that involves files
 * (which is most things in Git).
 *
 * In Node.js, you can pass the builtin `fs/promises` module.
 * In the browser it's more involved because there's no standard 'fs' module.
 * But you can use any module that implements enough of the `fs` API.
 *
 * ### Node.js
 * If you're only using the library in Node.js, you can just use the native `fs/promises` module:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import fs from 'fs/promises'
 * import { listFiles } from 'git-essentials'

 * const files = await listFiles({ fs, dir: dirname })
 * console.log(files)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Browser
 * For testing purposes, the library includes in-memory file system implementations
 * which can be used on both Node.js and browser environments.
 * For persistent production use, you will have to use 3rd party client or your own implementation.
 * ```typescript
 * import { InMemoryFsClient } from 'git-essentials/clients/fs/InMemoryFsClient'
 * import { listFiles } from 'git-essentials'
 *
 * const fs = new InMemoryFsClient()
 * const files = await listFiles({ fs, dir: dirname })
 * console.log(files)
 * ```
